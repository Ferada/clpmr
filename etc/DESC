CLPMR is a replacement for procmail written in Common Lisp, for those
sick and tired of half-backed, semi-powerful, partially-engineered,
almost-flexible tools with a paleolithic syntax made to be easy for
the CPU rather than for the user.

In practice CLPMR provides the full power/semplicity of Lisp to write
mail delivery filters that are fast and maintainable.
